KWASM Lemmas
============

These lemmas aid in verifying WebAssembly programs behavior.
They are part of the *trusted* base, and so should be scrutinized carefully.

```k
module KWASM-LEMMAS
    imports WASM-TEXT
```

When reasoning about `#chop`, it's often the case that the precondition to the proof contains the information needed to indicate no overflow.
In this case, it's simpler (and safe) to simply discard the `#chop`, instead of evaluating it.

```k
    rule #chop(< ITYPE:IValType > N) => < ITYPE > N
      requires #inUnsignedRange(ITYPE, N)

    syntax Bool ::= #inUnsignedRange (IValType, Int) [function]
 // -----------------------------------------------------------
    rule #inUnsignedRange (ITYPE, I) => 0                 <=Int I andBool I <Int #pow (ITYPE)
```

```k
endmodule
```
